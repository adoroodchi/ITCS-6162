Project Introduction: 
The Alzheimer's Disease dataset, sourced from Kaggle and curated by Rabie Elkharoua, provides comprehensive information pertinent to understanding and analyzing Alzheimer's Disease. This dataset includes a range of variables such as demographic details, medical history, cognitive test scores, and imaging data, offering a multidimensional view of patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease. 

The primary goal of this project is predictive analysis, aiming to develop models that can forecast the progression and onset of Alzheimer's Disease based on the available data. This will be accomplished using supervised learning techniques, with a focus on classification to distinguish between different stages of the disease. Additionally, regression models may be employed to predict specific cognitive scores or other continuous outcomes.

By leveraging classification algorithms, such as logistic regression and decision trees, alongside advanced techniques like random forests and support vector machines, this project seeks to build robust predictive models. The end objective is to contribute to the early detection and effective management of Alzheimer's Disease, potentially informing clinical decisions and improving patient outcomes.

Research Question:
How accurately can we predict the progression of Alzheimer's Disease in patients using demographic, medical, cognitive, and imaging data?

Data Source and Description:
The Alzheimer's Disease dataset is sourced from Kaggle, curated by Rabie Elkharoua. It includes variables such as age, gender, education level, cognitive test scores, MRI measures, and more. This dataset provides a detailed view of the factors associated with Alzheimer's Disease. The dataset can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset

Data Understanding and EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed several insights into the dataset:

The distribution of ages in the dataset shows a higher frequency of older adults.
Cognitive test scores exhibit variation across different stages of Alzheimer's Disease.

Data Preparation:
Data preparation involved several steps to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:

1. Handling missing values by imputation or removal.
2. Encoding categorical variables, such as gender and education level.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.
   
Further details and steps will be outlined in Deliverable 2.
